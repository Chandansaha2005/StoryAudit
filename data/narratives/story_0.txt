NOVEL: THE MEDIC OF WHITEHOLLOW
CHAPTER ONE: THE HEALER

Dr. Alina Moore arrived in Whitehollow during the winter plague. She treated patients tirelessly, refusing payment. Her methods were traditional, cautious, and conservative.

She explicitly rejected experimental treatments, believing they caused more harm than good.

CHAPTER TWO: THE LIMITS

Despite her care, many patients died. Alina documented symptoms but avoided speculation. She warned villagers against panic and rumors.

She never claimed certainty.

CHAPTER THREE: THE END

Alina contracted the illness herself. She continued treating others until she collapsed. She died without proposing a cure.

Her journals ended abruptly, filled with uncertainty and questions.

EPILOGUE

Years later, medical scholars studied her journals. They praised her restraint and ethical caution, noting that she resisted dangerous experimentation.
