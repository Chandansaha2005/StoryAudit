BACKSTORY: CAPTAIN JAMES WHITMORE - THE TRUTH

BIRTH AND EARLY LIFE
James Whitmore was born on March 15, 1654, in London (not Portsmouth as the official records claim). His father was a clerk in the East India Company, and his mother was the daughter of a convicted pirate. This family connection would shape his entire life.

PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER TRAITS
- Extremely intelligent, with unusual mathematical ability
- Ruthless when necessary, but not impulsive
- Perfectionist in his work, obsessive about detail
- Emotionally cold, incapable of genuine attachment
- Strategic thinker who plans years ahead
- Charismatic when he chooses to be, terrifying when he doesn't

NAVAL CAREER - THE FALSE NARRATIVE
The official records claim Whitmore joined the Navy at age 14. This is partially true—he did join, but not as a midshipman. He was a stowaway aboard a merchant vessel that was later impressed into Navy service. He rose through the ranks by systematically eliminating competitors through sabotage and falsified reports.

ACTUAL HISTORY (REDACTED FROM OFFICIAL RECORDS)
- Learned piracy from his grandfather between ages 8-11
- Participated in four pirate raids in 1675-1677 under the alias "the Pale Commander"
- Deliberately sank three merchant vessels to eliminate witnesses (1678-1680)
- Orchestrated the appearance of naval authority through forged documents (1681 onwards)

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
- Height: 6'3" (unusually tall for the 17th century)
- Left eye damaged in 1678, but by a cutlass wound, not a cannon explosion (official version)
- Extensive scar tissue on chest and back from various conflicts
- Unusually strong grip, resulting from years of rope work and violence

KNOWN MURDERS
1. Thomas Blackwell (quartermaster) - 1683 - pushed overboard after discovering ledger evidence
2. Samuel Price (first mate) - 1685 - poisoned in his cabin with arsenic
3. Richard Evans (cabin boy) - 1687 - apparent suicide, actually suffocated
4. Multiple unnamed sailors - at least seven others during his "privateering years"

RELATIONSHIPS AND ASSOCIATES
- His only genuine friend: Admiral William Norris, who may have known the truth but benefited from his rise
- His enemy: Sebastian Price, a naval investigator sent to investigate him in 1689
- His handler: Unknown member of the Crown, possibly in the Admiralty itself, who protected him

MOTIVATIONS
Power, money, and the pure satisfaction of control. Whitmore was not motivated by patriotism or honor. He built his reputation on lies, maintained it through murder, and lived in constant fear of exposure. This fear never paralyzed him—it made him more cautious, more calculating, more dangerous.

RETIREMENT MYSTERY
Why Whitmore retired at age 58 remains unclear. Official explanation: health reasons. Likely explanation: Sebastian Price's letter, though never made public, rattled powerful people. Whitmore may have been bought off or threatened. His "quiet life" in Cornwall included multiple visitors from London, all documented as "old friends," though no names are recorded.

FINAL ASSESSMENT
Captain James Whitmore was one of the most successful criminals in British naval history, precisely because he was never caught. His crimes were perfect because he was meticulous. His legacy is untarnished because he had powerful protectors. He died in 1722 at age 68, wealthy, respected, and entirely free.

The fire that destroyed his journals in 1755 was no accident.
