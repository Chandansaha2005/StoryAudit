The Ledger of Lost Seconds

In the year 1892, a clockmaker named Elias Thorne disappeared from the village of Oakhaven. He didn't just leave; he vanished from inside a locked workshop. The villagers claimed they heard a sound like a "shattering mirror" at exactly 12:01 AM.

For decades, the workshop remained sealed until Project: Horizon (ID: PX-99) reopened it in 2026. Researchers found that Thorne wasn't just fixing clocks—he was cataloging "leaks" in time. Every time a person felt "deja vu," Thorne recorded it as a data point in his master ledger.
