Noirtier de Villefort: Selected Backstory Claims

Early Life and Political Awakening:
- Born into a Parisian legal family, he absorbed his father's staunch republicanism and his mother's gentler sensibility, learning to balance reason with feeling.
- Growing up in Paris he devoured Voltaire and Rousseau, burning with enthusiasm for liberty and equality.
- At eighteen he joined a radical republican cell, speaking in cafés and back-room meetings for the revolutionary cause.

Revolutionary Era:
- Under the alias "Citizen Noirtier" he joined the Girondins, drafted parts of the Revolutionary Code and broke with Robespierre over whether courts should keep formal procedures.
- During the Revolution he acted as a militant republican, attended major assemblies and helped organise trials of royalists.
- His father was guillotined in 1792 for hiding exiled aristocrats; watching the blade fall left him with chronic hand tremors and lifelong revulsion for the old regime.
- His parents were targeted in a reprisal for supporting the Revolution; his mother was killed, deepening his distrust of authority.

Napoleonic Era and Double Life:
- Working directly for Fouché, he organised the assassination of royalist deputies while posing as a Ministry of Justice official; the arsenic phial still lies in a hidden drawer of his study desk.
- He allowed his private doctor to test a new sedative on political prisoners to treat his worsening hand tremors; the secret gave him leverage over enemies even after paralysis set in.

The Hundred Days and Family Conflict:
- He secretly raised the "Southern Army" in Marseille for Napoleon but left traceable evidence—copies of the ciphered letters hidden inside oak barrels in his own vineyard, later unearthed by Villefort.
- Discovering that his elder son Gérard (Villefort) sought to wed into the old aristocracy, Noirtier publicly burned the Saint-Méran betrothal contract (1804), forcing Villefort to flee to Paris overnight.

Wisdom and Influence:
- He kept a locked study full of revolutionary pamphlets and private letters, rereading them alone while he weighed his past.
- Through underground circles he met the Count of Monte Cristo and fed the avenger vital information, lending invisible aid to the plot against his enemies.
- Though bodily strength ebbed he still pulled strings through old friends, quietly encouraging several anti-royalist moves.

Later Years and Paralysis:
- When he saw that Valentine had inherited his trembling hands he began training her to communicate by eye movement (1819); after his own paralysis the method evolved into a blink-code.
- Hidden Waterloo-era diplomatic letters in his study ensured that political foes dared not silence him, explaining how he could still shield Valentine after losing the power of speech.
