Thalcave: Selected Backstory Claims

Early Life and Family:
- Thalcave's people faded as colonists advanced; his father, last of the tribal guides, knew the pampas geography and animal ways, while his mother died giving birth.
- Boyhood was spent roaming the plains with his father, learning to track, tame horses and steer by the stars.
- Colonists killed his father for refusing to reveal migration routes, and the thirteen-year-old fled alone, carrying his father's silver horse-gear.

Wilderness Years:
- For two years he lived solo in the Andean border wilds, tempering an ice-cold nerve by trailing pumas and dodging bandits.
- He saved an old shepherd bitten by a viper; in gratitude the man gave him a secret map of pampas water-holes and taught him that a guide's duty is to keep life moving.
- Watching natives slaughtered in a raid re-awakened his conscience: he cached weapons, torched the trader and raised a stone marker beside the blaze to record his regret and repentance.

Horse Mastery:
- On the Patagonian frontier he trapped a wary black stallion named Thaouka and spent three months taming it with ancient Tehuelche methods.
- While gentling Thaouka they plunged off a cliff; badly hurt, he chewed herbs to staunch the bleeding and survived, forging with the horse a bond deeper than master and beast.

Spiritual Development:
- Early trauma: at seven his father vanished in a local uprising, at nine his mother died of illness; a banished Jesuit, Father Leclere, raised him in a mountain mission.
- The mission priest taught him Quechua, Spanish and French, showed him European maps, the stars and the arithmetic of navigation.
- Loss turned him taciturn, acting more than speaking; he felt deep pity for sufferers and stayed calmly watchful toward oppressors.

Remarkable Achievements:
- After predicting an earthquake and saving the entire party he declined payment, asking only that the credit go to "the spirit of the plains."
- South-latitude incident: off the Chilean coast he ferried water and provisions to a burning barque and fished a sailor from the sea during a squall.
- British officers marvelled that he handled canoe, coast and jungle with equal ease, shuttling supplies and so preparing his later berth on the Dartmouth.

Mission and Recognition:
- Lord Glenarvan met him briefly at a London Royal Geographical Society dinner, was struck by his encyclopaedic knowledge of mountains and seas and hired him at once as guide for the South-American interior.
- With the rescue squad he learned enough nautical English to converse with Captain Horace and the sailors.
