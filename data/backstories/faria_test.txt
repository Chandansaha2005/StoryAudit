The Abbé Faria: Selected Backstory Claims

Early Life and Academic Achievements:
- Born in 1760 to a declining Italian noble house, he devoured the family library and startled tutors with his memory.
- By eighteen he was a star student at Rome University, fluent in several languages and already publishing notes on history and natural philosophy.
- University lectures on Enlightenment science convinced him that religion and reason could be fused into one worldview.

Academic Background:
- At twelve he entered Bologna University, read theology and chemistry, and caused a stir by decoding ciphers in a fifteenth-century alchemist's notebook.
- As a Jesuit novice he was sent to Goa, secretly read the old Indian medical text Charaka Samhita and laid the groundwork for his later toxicology expertise.

Political Intrigue:
- In Lisbon he backed constitutionalist Prince Pedro, was branded a Jacobin plotter out to poison King John VI and fled conservatives' pursuit.
- French gendarmes seized him at Toulon, accusing him of planning to bomb Bourbon restoration festivities; the real motive was that his code-breaking threatened a cardinal's secret correspondence.

Life in Captivity Before Château d'If:
- First confined in Fenestrella Fortress, he scratched "On Ancient Mediterranean Routes" into limestone with a nail; the warden later plagiarised the essay.
- Aboard the prison transport he met Edmond Dantès' father, heard tales of the merchant Pharaon and thus gained the first thread that later let him recognise the young sailor.
- He invented a "salt-blood" ink that revealed under heat, used it to help a Corsican patriot escape, and was transferred to the more secure Château d'If for the trouble.

The Origin of the Key Artifact:
- He learnt to carve fish-bone pen-nibs from an old Macao watchmaker, letting him pursue scholarship without proper tools.
- His invisible-ink formula came from temple-mural restoration in India, first used to rescue local epics the colonists had defaced.

The Formation of Spiritual Traits:
- During twenty years in one cell he kept his wits by calculating Mediterranean tides, an exercise that later let him predict guards' rounds in the original story.
- His sister was burned as a witch for spurning a nobleman; the injustice fed a lifelong hatred of institutional rot.
- In India he watched British troops crush a rising; to spare the rebel leader further torture he gave the man a merciful death, shaping his ethic of "killing when kindness demands it."
